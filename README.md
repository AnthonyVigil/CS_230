# CS-230: Operating Platforms
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
The client was The Gaming Room. The client had a game available via Android called Draw It or Lose it and was seeking to make it multi-platform with improved software functionality. 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing the documentation, I researched and organized all the requirements and recommendations needed for this project.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document helped with progression of important factors for the goal. Instead of working on several other factors, it helped focus on the main requirements. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the recommended sections. As I have read many articles of what can help improve the game or system requirements, I am sure there is something better out there now for the requirements as technology is always improving.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By looking at the game actions, I was able to determine the user's needs and incorporate them into the software design. It is important to keep in mind that the user wants to be able to play the same game while being on a different platform. The game must be compatible and secure to ensure the user will not have issues.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The approach for designing the software was to divide the sections, create a organized or clear document, focus on functionality, maintenance, and costs. I would utilize all the techniques as they are very helpful and time-efficient.
